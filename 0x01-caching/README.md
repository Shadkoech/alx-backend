# Caching

## Overview
Caching is a fundamental concept in computer science and software engineering that addresses the challenge of optimizing performance and reducing latency in systems dealing with large volumes of data. It involves storing frequently accessed or computed data in a temporary storage location, called a cache, closer to the point of use. By doing so, caching aims to improve the speed and efficiency of data retrieval operations, thereby enhancing the overall performance of applications and systems.

## Covered concepts
For this project and contained exercises, we learn the following:
- What caching strategies are available and how to implement them using Python decorators
- What the LRU, MRU, LFU, FIFO strategies are and how they work
- How to improve performance by caching with the @lru_cache decorator

## Tasks
- Basic dictionary
- FIFO caching
- LIFO Caching
- LRU Caching
- MRU Caching
- LFU Caching
